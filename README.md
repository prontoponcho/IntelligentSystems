# IntelligentSystems
###Objects exhibit/imitate intelligent behavior through random walks, natural movements, collision avoidance, goal seeking, &amp; feedback adjustments.
Each task folder represents a more complex behavior than the previous:
<ol>
  <li>Task 1: Rational Bird Agent characterized by...
    <ul>
      <li>randomized track of x, y, z coordinates</li>
      <li>yaw, pitch, and roll match movement direction</li>
      <li>smooth turns</li>
      <li>small noisy movements indicative of bird flight</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 2: Dolphin & Fish characterized by...
    <ul>
      <li>dolphin chasing fish within field of vision</li>
      <li>fish avoid immediate collisions with each other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 3: Bee Search, Communication, and Cooperation characterized by...
    <ul>
      <li>scout bee detects flower location</li>
      <li>scout communicates flower location to worker bees</li>
      <li>bees meet at flower location</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 4: Belief, Desire, Intent model for Blimp Navigation
    <ul>
      <li>blimp travels along a square path using two transmitters to resolve its believed location with its desired location</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 5: Bat Echolocation
    <ul>
      <li>Bat detects and tracks moving insects using echolocation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 6: Topography-Sensitive Utility Ant
    <ul>
      <li>Ant follows utility theory by avoiding negative stimuli (pesticide) and seeking positive stimuli (food)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task 7: Pterrordactyl Drone
    <ul>
      <li>Aerodynamic modeling where speed, roll, and weight affect altitude</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
